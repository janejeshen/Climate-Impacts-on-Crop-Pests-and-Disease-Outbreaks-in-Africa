# Climate-Impacts-on-Crop-Pests-and-Disease-Outbreaks-in-Africa
#### Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Adaptation Atlas Data Storytelling Challenge, an initiative aimed at making scientific climate knowledge more accessible to policymakers, researchers, and investors across Africa.

The focus of Track 2, proposed by the African Trust for Innovation (ATI), is to understand how changing climate patterns influence the spread, severity, and emergence of crop pests and diseases. These insights are critical for strengthening early warning systems, improving integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, and supporting climate-resilient agriculture.

The final output is an interactive data storytelling notebook, designed to communicate complex climate–agriculture relationships through clear visualizations and narrative-driven analysis.

#### Key Objectives

The notebook answers the following core questions:

1. Which crops are most vulnerable to climate-driven pest and disease pressures across different African regions?

2. How are changing climate patterns (temperature, rainfall, humidity) affecting pest and disease spread and severity?

3. Where are emerging pest and disease risks appearing due to shifting habitats and extended breeding seasons?

4. Which regions are likely to require increased surveillance, early warning systems, or adjustments to IPM strategies?

5. How have pest and disease patterns evolved over the past two decades, and how might they change under future climate scenarios such as SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5?

#### Data Sources

The analysis integrates multiple datasets, including:

Climate data (historical and projected): temperature, precipitation, and climate scenarios (SSPs)

Agricultural data: crop distribution and exposure

Pest and disease risk data: occurrence, suitability, and spread indicators

Socio-economic and regional data for contextual interpretation

All datasets were provided or recommended within the Zindi competition Data tab and partner resources.

#### Tools & Technologies

Observable Notebooks – Interactive data analysis and storytelling

JavaScript & Python – Data processing and visualization

D3.js / Observable Plot – Interactive charts and maps

Markdown – Narrative storytelling

#### Key Insights & Findings

Certain staple crops show heightened vulnerability in warming and high-humidity regions.

Climate change is expanding pest habitats, increasing the risk of outbreaks in previously low-risk areas.

Regions with overlapping climate stressors and crop exposure should be prioritized for early warning systems.

Future climate scenarios indicate increased pest pressure intensity and duration, emphasizing the need for adaptive IPM strategies.
